# South Africa

Software Development Bootcamp - Week 1 Project - A simple webpage about South Africa.

## What requirements did you achieve?

All of them, as far as I can tell!

## Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

N/A

## If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I managed them all, although I did struggle to get the positioning of content correct in my popup window. Turned out to be simpler than I thought, which was just as well as I was struggling to keep track of all the containers!

## What went really well and what could have gone better?

I'm quite happy with it overall, though I was getting frustrated with the popup windows which took longer than I'd hoped. I was planning to add more popups and include a couple of things like carousel galleries, but ultimately decided to wait for a future project (or return to this at a later date) once I've got more to grips with vanilla CSS.
